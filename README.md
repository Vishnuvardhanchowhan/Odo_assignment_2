# Fine tuning process
Fine-tuning setup: Configure the fine-tuning process by selecting the appropriate hyperparameters and settings. These may include the learning rate, batch size, number of training steps, and other parameters that influence the training process.

Fine-tuning process: Start the fine-tuning process using the prepared dataset. This typically involves initializing the pre-trained language model with the weights learned during pre-training and then training it further on the custom dataset. The process involves feeding input sequences and training the model to generate appropriate responses.

# Evaluation

Evaluation metrics: Determine the evaluation metrics that are suitable for measuring the performance of the chatbot. Common metrics for chatbot evaluation include:

a. Accuracy: Calculate the percentage of correctly predicted responses from the chatbot compared to the expected answers in the test set.

b. Precision, recall, and F1-score: If the chatbot provides multiple options or generates multiple responses, you can evaluate the precision (the proportion of correct responses among the generated ones), recall (the proportion of correct responses identified among all the correct ones), and the F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) to assess the chatbot's performance.

c. BLEU score: If the expected answers are available in multiple reference versions, you can use the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, a popular metric used to evaluate the quality of machine translation or text generation. It measures the n-gram overlap between the generated responses and the reference answers.

d. Human evaluation: To obtain more nuanced insights into the chatbot's performance, you can involve human evaluators who assess the quality, relevance, and overall satisfaction of the chatbot's responses. This can be done through manual rating or comparison with a baseline human response.

Conduct the evaluation: Run the test set through the openLLAMA chatbot model and collect the model's responses. Compare these responses with the expected answers in the test set using the chosen evaluation metrics.

Analyze the results: Analyze the evaluation metrics to assess the chatbot's performance. Identify any areas where the model excels or falls short. Look for patterns or common types of errors or inaccuracies in the responses.

Iteration and improvement: Based on the analysis, make adjustments to the chatbot model, fine-tuning process, or dataset if necessary. Refine the training process, add more training examples, or address specific issues that were identified during the evaluation.

Repeat and validate: Repeat the evaluation process with the refined model or updated chatbot. Validate the improvements made and assess the impact on the performance metrics. Continue this iterative process until the chatbot achieves satisfactory performance on the books test set.
