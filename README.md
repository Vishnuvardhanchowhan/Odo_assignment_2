# Fine tuning process
Fine-tuning setup: Configure the fine-tuning process by selecting the appropriate hyperparameters and settings. These may include the learning rate, batch size, number of training steps, and other parameters that influence the training process.

Fine-tuning process: Start the fine-tuning process using the prepared dataset. This typically involves initializing the pre-trained language model with the weights learned during pre-training and then training it further on the custom dataset. The process involves feeding input sequences and training the model to generate appropriate responses.
